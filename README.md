everytime i want to do something there is always a tiny problem, sometimes i can fix the problem, sometimes i cant and i have to leave the thing i was doing. some people call this bad luck, but i call this adventure.
so there is always that ONE answer that helps you. so i made this repo so everytime i have a problem, i show it here and show the sloution that worked for me.
or if i couldnt fix it maybe you guys can help me.

and so problematico begins!
