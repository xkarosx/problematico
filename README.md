everytime i want to do something there is always a tiny problem, sometimes i can solve the problem, sometimes i cant and i have to leave the thing i was doing. some people call this bad luck, but i call this adventure.
so there is always that ONE answer that helps you. so i made this repo so everytime i have a problem, i show it here and show the sloution that worked for me.
or if i couldnt solve it maybe you guys can help me. or some of you have problems and post them in the issues tab and maybe someone well know the solution!
this place isnt limited by some particular subject, so if you have any questions about anything or answers about any question you can post your question/sloution here in
